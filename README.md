# IIT-ISM-Dhanbad-Official-Website
Used HTML,CSS,Javascript,Bootstrap and PHP mostly,to develop this complete project right from scratch.For some dynamic data,I used php otherwise for all static one the front end languages and frameworks were enough.
Index.php- is the main landing and front page of complete project.
The header and footer are made using PHP as they need to be remain same all the sub pages.
Overall the complete website contains more than 150 web pages.
